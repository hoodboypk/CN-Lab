Import necessary libraries:

Import the required Java libraries, including BufferedReader, IOException, and Scanner.

Define the main method:

Create the main method, which is the entry point of the program.
Create a Scanner object to read user input.
Prompt the user to enter the target IP address.
Read the target IP address from the user.
Call the getMacAddress function:


Pass the target IP address entered by the user as an argument to the getMacAddress function.
Store the result in a variable (macAddress).

Display the result:

Check if the macAddress variable is not null.
If it's not null, display the MAC address along with the target IP address.
If it's null, display an error message indicating that the MAC address couldn't be found for the target IP address.

Define the getMacAddress function:

Create the getMacAddress function, which takes an IP address as input.
Inside the function:
Use ProcessBuilder to execute the "arp -a" command with the provided IP address.
Redirect the error stream to the input stream.
Start the process.
Create a BufferedReader to read the process's input stream.
Iterate through the lines of output from the process.
For each line:
Check if it contains the target IP address.
If it does, use a regular expression to extract the MAC address from the line.
Return the extracted MAC address if found.
After processing all lines, wait for the process to complete and retrieve its exit code.
If the exit code is not zero, display an error message.
Handle any potential exceptions during this process.

End the program:

Close the Scanner (if it was opened).
The program execution is complete.
