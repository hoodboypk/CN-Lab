Server Side:

Create a server socket to listen for incoming connections.
Wait for a client to initiate a connection request.
Accept the incoming connection, creating a new socket to communicate with the client.
Receive the SYN segment from the client.
Send a SYN-ACK segment back to the client with its own initial sequence number (ISN).
Receive the ACK segment from the client, acknowledging the server's SYN.

Client Side:

Create a client socket and specify the server's IP address and port number.
Send a SYN segment to the server, indicating the client's initial sequence number (ISN).
Receive the SYN-ACK segment from the server, containing the server's ISN.
Send an ACK segment back to the server, acknowledging the server's SYN-ACK and completing the handshake.

Data Transfer:

After the handshake is completed, both the client and server can send and receive data over the established connection.
Data is transmitted using TCP segments with sequence numbers to ensure reliable and ordered delivery.
